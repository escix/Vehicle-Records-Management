PREQUSITES FOR TRACKER OPERATION:

- Webserver with PHP
   (PHP must have been compiled with db2 support --with-ibm-db2 )
  Tested webservers: Apache 2.0.53 
  PHP Level 5.0.4 (no reason it shouldn't work on PHP4,
   but haven't tested)
  Sorry, no MySQL yet, but I plan it. I do ue the odbc calls, so
  I think, from what I read, that only the connect statment differs
  and all the rest of the database calls are ok? Not sure, but I think.

- DB2 V7.1 or above (any marketing package eg UDB, Personal ..etc)

- ImageMagick 5.4.2 or above (from  http://www.imagemagick.org )

- Any UNIX Operating system (Sorry, no windows..perhaps in the future)
  (What doesn't work on windows you ask, there's a few shell calls
   for image convert and one other for version, simple enough to 
   case out but havn't done it, there's propably more than that as
   well, I've never used PHP on windows, so I don't know)
   - For clarity sake, I've only tested this on AIX V5.3ML04, but
     I really see no reason it shouldn't run out of the box on any 
     UNIX OS.

INSTALLATION STEPS

Step 0:
 Read the license agreement in the LICENSE file

Step 1:
  Untar the package somewhere in your webspace



Step 2:
  Database setup
  You'll find everything you need in dbschema directory
  Edit the create_tables.clp and triggers.clp for proper 
    database name (ie connect to wwwdb), 
    tablespace name (ie IN WWW)
      (if you have a tbsp, if not get rid of the IN clauses)

  Once every name in there looks right, run them
  db2 -tf create_tables.clp
  db2 -tf triggers.clp

  Of course you need proper authority on the database.
  I ran all these as full db2 instance owner.

  If you want the demo subset of data imported,
  run import_demodata.sh. This is sample data 
  User demo is always authorized in the code
  and reads and edits this set of data.
  If you choose not to import the demo data,
  feel free to delete the goofy named
  jpegs in the pics directory (Setup in step 3)
  !!!But don't delete car.jpg!!!! It's the default
  thumbnail used until a user uploads their own
  vehicle pictures.



Step 3:
  VST Setup
  edit config.php for it's parameters. 
  They are all be explained in config.php file



Step 4:
  Ensure "convert" (Imagemagick) is in the webserver user's path
  (so whoever the webserver runs as (like user nobdoy), make
  sure he can execute the convert command)


Step 5:
  You probably want to edit VSTInfo.php for whatever you want
  to say. I think I left some machine and site stats in there

Step 6:
  Try it out! If you imported the demo data, logon as demo/demo,
  otherwise you'll need to register yourself first.
